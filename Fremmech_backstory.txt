Fremmech is an orphan from the town of Ool Krut of the Eight Cities, who was bought by a pirate captain from a disreputable orphanage to serve as a cabin boy. After some years in the service of The Captain, Fremmech was trusted with helping to fence goods via clandestine ports and and back-woods trade routes in and around the Eight Cities region. Fremmech developed skills as both a thief and a woodsman. 

Doublecrossed by a rival in the pirateâ€™s guild, Fremmech fell out of favor with The Captain and made his escape to Lankhmar, where he is newly arrived and looking to make a new name for himself. Fremmech was not the name he used before landing in Lankhmar.
